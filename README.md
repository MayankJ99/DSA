# DSA
This will be a place where I drop my DSA notes as much as I can. I guess while i practice LC, I can probably make notes and answers for some popular LC questions and exlore the underlying work, thought process, patterns and such to categorize approaches one would take to solve these in an interview setting.


The biggest thing I struggle with is looking at a problem and trying to figure out what algorithm is best used. 

This is my attempt at fixing that.
